    "In this lesson, you'll practice doing a power-analysis during experimental design. As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints.\n",

    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",

You ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power (for a given alpha and effect size). Running simulations like this as well as further investigations regarding required sample sizes for higher power thresholds or smaller effect sizes is critical in designing meaningful experiments where one can be confident in the subsequent conclusions drawn."
