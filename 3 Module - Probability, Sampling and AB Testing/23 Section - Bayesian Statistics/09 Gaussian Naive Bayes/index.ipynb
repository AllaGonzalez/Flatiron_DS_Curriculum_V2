    "Expanding Bayes theorem to account for multiple observations and conditional probabilities drastically increases predictive power. In essence, it allows you to develop a belief network taking into account all of the available information regarding the scenario. In this lesson, you'll take a look at one particular implementation of a multinomial naive Bayes algorithm: Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",

    "## Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Bayes expands upon Bayes' Theorem to multiple observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Bayes' Theorem is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Large P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)\\bullet P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding to multiple features, the Multinomial Bayes' formula is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Large P(y|x_1,x_2,...x_n) = \\frac{P(y)\\prod_{i}^{n}P(x_i|y)}{P(x_1,x_2,...x_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here y is an observation class while $x_1$ through $x_n$ are various features of of the observation. Similar to linear regression, these features are assumed to be linearly independent. The motivating idea is that the various features $x_1, x_2,...x_n$ will help inform which class a particular observation belongs to. This could be anything from 'Does this person have a disease?' to 'Is this credit card purchase fraudulent' or 'What marketing audience does this individual fall into?'. For example, in a minute, you'll look at the classic Iris dataset. This dataset includes various measurements of a flower's anatomy and the specific species of the flower. For that dataset, y would be the flower species while $x_1$ through $x_n$ would be the various measurements for a given flower. As such, the equation for Multinomial Bayes, given above, would allow you to calculate the probability that a given flower is of species A, or species B.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's dig into the formula a little more to get a deeper understanding. In the numerator, you multiply the product of the conditional probabilities $P(x_i|y)$ by the probability of the class y. The denominator is the overall probability (across all classes) for the observed values of the various features. In practice, this can be difficult or impossible to calculate. Fortunately, doing so is typically not required, as you will simply be comparing the relative probabilities of the various classes&mdash;do you believe this flower is of species A, species B or species C?  \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate each of the conditional probabilities in the numerator, $P(x_i|y)$, the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm traditionally uses the Gaussian probability density function to give a relative estimate of the probability of the feature observation, $x_i$, for the class y. Some statisticians object to this, as the probability of any point on a PDF curve is actually 0. As you've seen in z-tests and t-tests, only ranges of values have a probability, and these are calculated by taking the area under the PDF curve for the given range. While true, these point estimates can be loosely used as 'the relative probability for values near $x_i$'. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that, you have:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large P(x_i|y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_i^2}}e^{\\frac{-(x-\\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_i$ is the mean of feature $x_i$ for class y and $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of feature $x_i$ for class y.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, each of the relative posterior probabilities are calculated for each of the classes.  \n",
    "The largest of these is the class which is the most probable for the given observation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's take a look in practice to try to make this process a little clearer."

As such, it will be a constant across all of these posterior class probabilities. Since you are simply interested in the most likely class for each observation, you can simply pick the class with the largest numerator. With that, let's adapt the code snippet above to create a function which predicts a class for a given row of data."
