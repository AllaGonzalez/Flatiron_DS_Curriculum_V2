If there are a large number of variables, these sample spaces can explode very quickly. Often, these spaces are so large that analyzing all possible outcomes is not  possible. As an alternative, these large sets can be approximated using Monte Carlo simulations.

To demonstrate this, Create a graph to show how the number of permutations increases as we increase just one of the sample sizes. Assume that our first sample is of 25 individuals. From there, plot a graph of how the permutation test sample size increases drastically as our second sample increases from 10 to 200 individuals.

Even with our previous sample sizes of a sample of 14 and a sample of 12, we had a total of over 9 million possible outcomes. As you can see from the graph above, this quantity continues to rapidly increase. As a result, it is often impractical or impossible to calculate all possible variations. Instead, use a Monte Carlo Simulation to sample from the sample space in order to emulate a permutation test. While a precise simulation of a permutation test would record which ordered combinations we have already simulate, doing so greatly reduces the speed of the process. Below is the complete samples of two populations blood pressure.  \n", "  \n", "Write a Monte Carlo simulation to sample from the permutation space.
