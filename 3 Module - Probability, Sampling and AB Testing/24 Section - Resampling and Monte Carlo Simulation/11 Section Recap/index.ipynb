    "* The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test can be used to test the \"normality assumption\" for a given data set\n",
    "* More generally, the KS Test is a way to compare the similarity of two different distributions\n",
    "* A one-sample KS Test (goodness of fit test) calculates the similarity between an observed data set and a theoretical distribution.\n",
    "* A two-sample KS Test compares the similarity of two separate empirical distributions\n",
    "* The `make_blobs()` method in sklearn is one way to generate a synthetic data set\n",
    "* The `make_moons()` method allows for the generation of data for binary classification problems\n",
    "* There are a number of other useful methods such as `make_circles()` and `make_regression()` for generating various types of data sets for testing your algorithms\n",
    "* Resampling methods allow for improved precision in estimating sample statistics and validating models by using random subsets\n",
    "* Common resampling techniques include bootstrapping, jackknifing and permutation tests\n",
    "* Monte Carlo Simulations are a powerful tool for running large numbers of simulations with various inputs to provide distributions of possible output values\n"
