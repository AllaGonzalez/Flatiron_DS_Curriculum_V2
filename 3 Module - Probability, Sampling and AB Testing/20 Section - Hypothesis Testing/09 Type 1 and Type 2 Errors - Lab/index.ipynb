A test provides evidence for or against the null hypothesis and then you decide whether to accept or reject it based on that evidence, but the evidence may lack the strength to arrive at the correct conclusion. Incorrect conclusions made from hypothesis tests fall in one of two categories, i.e. [Type 1 and Type 2 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) By running some of these simulations, you should have a better idea of why a 95% confidence level is often used for hypothesis testing.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to:\n", "\n", "* Explain why alpha = 0.05 is chosen as the cutoff point for rejecting the null hypothesis in most scientific experiments\n", "* Simulate Type I and Type II errors with alpha control to observe the output of an experiment\n", "* Describe and differentiate between TYPE I and TYPE II errors\n", "* Understand alpha and beta for representing false positive and false negative values\n", "\n", "## Alpha and Beta\n", "\n", "**Alpha ($\\alpha$):** is the probability of a Type I error i.e. finding a difference when a difference does not exist. \n", "\n", "Most medical literature uses an alpha cut-off of 5% (0.05), indicating a 5% chance that a significant difference is actually due to chance and is not a true difference. \n", "\n", "**Beta ($\\beta$):** is the probability of a Type II error i.e. not detecting a difference when one actually exists. \n", "\n", "Beta is directly related to study power (Power = $1 - \\beta$) which you will investigate further in the next lesson.
