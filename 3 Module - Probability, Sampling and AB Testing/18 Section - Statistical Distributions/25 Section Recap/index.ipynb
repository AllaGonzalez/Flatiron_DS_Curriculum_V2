    "\n",
    "In this section, we really dug into statistical distributions. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "* There are two types of distributions - continuous, where (subject to measurement and/or storage precision) there are effectively an infinite number of possible values, and discrete, where there are a distinct, non-infinite number of options. For example, a persons height is continuous - assuming a suitably precise tape measure - whereas the number of bedrooms in a house is discrete\n",
    "* How to describe the distribution of data sets using Probability Mass Functions, Cumulative Distribution Functions and Probability Density Functions\n",
    "* One type of discrete distribution deals with a series of boolean events or trials - often called Bernoulli Trials\n",
    "* A Normal distribution is the classic \"bell curve\" with 68% of the probability mass within 1 sd of the mean, 95% within 2 sd's and 99.7% within 3 sd's\n",
    "* Differences between the normal and the standard normal distribution\n",
    "* How skewness and kurtosis can be used to measure how different a given distribution is from a normal distribution\n",
    "* The uses of z-scores and p-values for describing a distribution\n",
    "* How a one sample z-test is a very simple form of hypothesis testing.\n",
    "* A uniform distribution represents a process where each outcome is equally likely. A typical example is a dice roll.\n",
    "* The Poisson distribution can be used to display the likelihood of a given number of successes over a given time period - e.g. \"how likely is it that 25 people walk into a store in a given hour?\"\n",
    "* The Exponential distribution can be used to describe the probability distribution of the amount of time it may take before a given event occurs\n",
