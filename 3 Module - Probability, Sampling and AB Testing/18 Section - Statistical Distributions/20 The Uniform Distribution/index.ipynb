    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've been introduced to both discrete (Binomial) and continuous (Normal) distributions, and know how to perform a simple test, let's move on with some more distributions. The uniform distribution is a special one, as there is a discrete as well as a continuous version of this distribution!\n",

    "## Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Uniform Distribution** describes an event where every possible outcome is equally likely.  No single outcome carries any more or less probability of happening than any other possible outcome.  **The Uniform Distribution can be discrete or continuous**. \n",

    "## The Discrete Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen an example of a Discrete Uniform Distribution before: rolling a 6-sided dice. This idea can be extended to an $n$-sided dice. No matter how many sides the dice has, with a fair dice, you'd be equally likely to roll every side.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If $a$ is the smallest number, and $b$ is the biggest number that can be observed (for a fair dice, $a=1$, $b=6$)\n",

    "**Probability Mass Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) = \\dfrac{1}{(b − a+1)}\\text{ when } a \\leq x \\leq b, \\text{and} $$ \n",
    "$$p(x) = 0\\text{ when }x \\notin ]a, b[ $$\n",

    "**Uniform Distribution Mean:**\n",

    "$$E(X)= \\frac{a + b}{2}$$\n",

    "**Uniform Distribution Variance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Var(X) = \\sqrt{\\frac{(b-a)(b-a+2)}{12}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "An example of a **Continuous Uniform** would be the waiting for an elevator that could be on any floor in the building when you call it and can take between 0 and 40 seconds to arrive at your floor. Since the elevator is equally likely to be at any given floor, you can assume every amount of time between 0 and 40 seconds before the elevator arrives (decimals and fractions allowed, to an infinite amount of precision). The formulas for a continuous uniform distribution diverge slightly!\n",

    "$$f(x) = 0\\text{ when }x \\notin [a, b[ $$\n",

    "**Uniform Distribution Mean:**\n",

    "**Uniform Distribution Variance**:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** If you're confused why there is a 12 in the denominator of the formula of the variance for a Uniform Distribution, you're not alone.  The short answer is that it involves calculus. As a data scientist, you don't need to understand the derivation of this formula and where this 12 comes from. However, if you're interested, this [quora answer gives an excellent explanation](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-a-12-in-the-variance-of-uniform-distribution)!\n",
