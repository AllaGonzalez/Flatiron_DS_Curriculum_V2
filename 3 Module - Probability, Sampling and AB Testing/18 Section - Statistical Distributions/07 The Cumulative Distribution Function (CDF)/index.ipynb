    "The PMF function that we saw before works great for inspecting discrete random variables and calculating their expected values. However, we did see that when moving towards continuous random variables, obtaining probabilities for observing a specific outcome is not possible (or simply put, the probabilities were 0). We also noted that when working with PDFs, you can't really read the y-axis and have to be careful with interpretation. In this lesson, you'll learn about the cumulative distribution function and how it is useful to overcome these issues.\n",

    "* Calculate CDF in python for a given discrete variable with limited set of possible values\n",

    "Recall how we could easily read probabilities from the dice PMF plot (\"The probability of throwing a 4 is 16.66%\"), but it is much harder to interpret the temperature pdf. What is the probability that the temperature is exactly 80 degrees? We learned in the previous lesson that all these so-called \"point probabilities\" are 0, so the bottom line is that it is very hard to \"read\" any interesting information from a PDF. The PDF is mainly there to get a sense of the data density, but you cannot readily read the y-axis to get to probabilities.\n",

    "What is the probability that you throw value $\\leq$ 4 when throwing a dice? 0.6667 or 66.67. For this discrete example it is pretty straightforward, as this is the probability of throwing a 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4, so $0.1666 * 4$.\n",
