# Section Recap

## Introduction

In this section, you learned about clustering. Here are the key takeaways from this section.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:
* There are two main types of clustering algorithms: non-hierarchical (K-Means) clustering, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering
* You can quantify the performance of a clustering algorithm using metrics such as Variance Ratios
* When working with the K-Means clustering algorithm, it is useful to create elbow plots to find an optimal value for K
* When using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, different linkage criteria can be used to determine which clusters should be merged and at what point
* Dendrograms and clustergrams are very useful visual tools in hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
* Advantages of K-Means clustering include easy implementation and speed, where a main disadvantage is that it isn't always straightforward how to pick the "right" value for K
* Advantages of hierarchical agglomerative clustering include easy visualization and intuitiveness, where a main disadvantage is that the result is very distance metric-dependent
* You can use supervised and unsupervised learning together to co-use them in an effective way, applications are Look-alike models in market segmentation and Semi-Supervised learning
