    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* There are two main types of clustering algorithms: non-hierarchical (K-Means) clustering, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering\n",
    "* You can quantify the performance of a clustering algorithm using metrics such as Variance Ratios\n",
    "* When working with the K-Means clustering algorithm, it is useful to create elbow plots to find an optimal value for K\n",
    "* When using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, different linkage criteria can be used to determine which clusters should be merged and at what point\n",
    "* Dendrograms and clustergrams are very useful visual tools in hierarchical agglomerative clustering.\n",
    "* Advantages of K-Means clustering include easy implementation and speed, where a main disadvantage is that it isn't always straightforward how to pick the \"right\" value for K\n",
    "* Advantages of hierarchical agglomerative clustering include easy visualization and intuitiveness, where a main disadvantage is that the result is very distance metric-dependent\n",
    "* You can use supervised and unsupervised learning together to co-use them in an effective way, applications are Look-alike models in market segmentation and Semi-Supervised learning\n"
