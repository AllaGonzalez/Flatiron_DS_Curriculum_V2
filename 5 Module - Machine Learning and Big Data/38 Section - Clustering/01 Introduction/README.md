# Introduction

## Introduction
In this section you'll learn about a useful unsupervised learning technique, clustering. This lesson summarizes the topics you'll be covering in this section.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what is covered in this section
* Understand and explain why the section will help you to become a data scientist

## Clustering

In this section we will be moving on to a second unsupervised learning technique: Clustering! Clustering techniques are very powerful when you want to group data with similar characteristics together, but have no pre-specified labels. The main goal of clustering is to create clusters that have a high similarity between the data belonging to one cluster, while aiming at in a low similarity between clusters.  

### K-Means Clustering

We start by providing a basic intuition of the K-Means Clustering algorithm. When using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters which you want to obtain is specified upfront, and the algorithm aims at the most "optimal" cluster centers given that there are K clusters.

### Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering

A second branch of clustering algorithms is hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Using hierarchical clustering, unlike K-Means clustering, you don't decide on the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, you start with $n$ clusters were $n$ is the number of data points, and at each step, join 2 clusters. You stop joining clusters when a certain criterion is used.

### Market Segmentation with Clustering

A very common and useful application of clustering is market segmentation. You'll practice your clustering skills on a market segmentation data set! 

### Semi-Supervised Learning

At the end of this section, you'll learn how semi-supervised learning techniques, which are increasingly popular in machine learning, combines both concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning.


## Summary

In this section, you'll learn how to use clustering techniques, which are very useful for finding patterns and grouping unlabeled data together.
