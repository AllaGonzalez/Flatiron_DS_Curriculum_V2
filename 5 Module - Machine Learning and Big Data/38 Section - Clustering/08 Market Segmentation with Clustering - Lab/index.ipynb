Overall, the quality of the clustering algorithm did a lot better than the first algorithm we ran on unscaled data. The best performance was achieved when reducing the number of Principal Components down to 4. The increase in model performance is likely due to the reduction in dimensionality. Although dropping the last 2 PCs means that we lose about 6% of our explained variance, this proved to be a net-positive trade-off for the reduction in dimensionality it provided. "
