Investigate n-dimensional spaces from n=1 to n=1000. In each of these, construct the 100 random points using a random number between -10 and 10 for each dimension of the point. From there, calculate the average distance from each of these points to the origin.

While more data will generally lead to better predictive results, it will also substantially increase training time. To demonstrate this, generate lists of random numbers as you did above. Then, use this list of random numbers as a feature in a mock dataset; choose an arbitrary coefficient and multiply the feature vector by this coefficient. Then sum these feature-coefficient products to get an output y. To spice things up (and not have a completely deterministic relationship), add a normally distributed white noise parameter to your output values. Fit an ordinary least squares model to your generated mock data. Repeat this for a varying number of features, and record the time required to fit the model. (Be sure to only record the time to train the model, not the time to generate the data.) Finally, plot the number of features, n, versus the training time for the subsequent model."
