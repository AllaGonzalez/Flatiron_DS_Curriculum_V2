    "# PCA Background: Covariance Matrix and Eigendecomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now that you've gotten a high level overview of the use cases for PCA and some general notes regarding the algorithm's implementation, its time to dive deeper into the theory behind PCA. In particular, you'll break down some of the primary components of the algorithm, including the covariance matrix and eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand covariance matrix calculation with implementation in numpy\n",
    "- Understand and explain Eigendecomposition with its basic characteristics\n",
    "- Explain the role of eigenvectors and eigenvalues in eigendecomposition\n",
    "- Decompose and re-construct a matrix using eigendecomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "## The PCA Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, recall the general procedure for PCA:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Recenter each feature of the dataset by subtracting that feature's mean from the feature vector\n",
    "2. Calculate the covariance matrix for your centered dataset\n",
    "3. Calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n",
    "4. Project the dataset into the new feature space: Multiply the eigenvectors by the mean centered features\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's start deconstructing some of these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "You've looked into correlation and covariance as measures to calculate how one random variable changes with respect to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is very similar to correlation, but may not be normalized. The formula for the covariance of two variable X and Y is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_i^n(X_i -\\mu_X)(Y_i - \\mu_Y)}{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Covariance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen covariance on its own, lets briefly examine a covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix for a set of data with n dimensions would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C^{n x n} = (c_{i,j}, c_{i,j} = cov(Dim_i, Dim_j))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C^{m x n}$ is a matrix with $n$ rows and $n$ columns, and $Dim_x$ is the $i$th dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have an n-dimensional data set, then the matrix has n rows and n columns (square matrix) and each entry in the matrix is the result of calculating the covariance between two separate dimensions as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/covmat.png\" width=350>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Down the main diagonal, we can see that the covariance value is between one of the dimensions and itself. These are the variances for that dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since $cov(a,b) = cov(b,a)$, the matrix is symmetrical about the main diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculate Covariance matrix in Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In numpy, you can calculate the covariance of a given matrix using `np.cov()` function,  as shown below:"

They are often referred as right vectors, which simply means a column vector (as opposed to a row vector or a left vector). Imagine a transformation matrix that, when multiplied on the left, reflected vectors in the line $y=x$. You can see that if there were a vector that lay on the line $y=x$, it’s reflection it itself. This vector (and all multiples of it), would be an eigenvector of that transformation matrix.\n",
