# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes key takeaways from this section on creating machine learning pipelines.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:
* Machine Learning Pipelines create a nice workflow to combine data manipulations, preprocessing and modeling
* Machine Learning Pipelines can be used along with grid search to evaluate several parameter settings
* For data sets with a lot of predictors and a certain correlation structure it's often recommended to look at PCA to reduce complexity first
* Grid search can considerably blow up computation time when computing for several parameters along with cross-validation
* Some models are very sensitive to hyperparameter changes, so they should be chosen with care, and even with big grids a good outcome isn't always guaranteed
