    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we shall cover decision trees (for classification) in python, using scikit-learn and pandas. The emphasis will be on the basics and understanding the resulting decision tree. Scikit-Learn provides a consistent interface for running different classifiers/regressors. For classification tasks, evaluation is performed using the same measures as we have seen before. Let's look at our example from earlier lessons and grow a tree to find our solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `pandas` to prepare the data for the scikit-learn decision tree algorithm\n",
    "- Train the classifier with a training dataset and evaluate performance using different measures\n",
    "- Visualize the decision tree and interpret the visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prepare data, train, evaluate and visualize a decision tree , we would need a number of packages in python. Here are the packages that you would normally consider importing before moving on. Run the cell below to import everything we'll need for this lesson. "

Then, since all of our data is currently categorical (recall that each column is in string format), we need to encode them as numbers. For this, we'll use a handy helper objects from sklearn's `preprocessing` module. Since our target, `play`, is in a binary format, we'll use `LabelEncoder`. Since our predictors are not binary, we'll instead use `OneHotEncoder` for them. Finally, we'll print the shape of each piece of transformed data in order to make sure that it all looks correct. \n",
