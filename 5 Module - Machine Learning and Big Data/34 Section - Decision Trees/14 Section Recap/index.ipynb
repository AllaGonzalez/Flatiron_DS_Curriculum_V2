    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory provides a mathematically rigorous definition of what machine learning is\n",
    "* The PAC is a learning model which is characterized by learning from examples\n",
    "* Decision trees can be used for both categorization and regression tasks\n",
    "* They are a powerful and interpretable technique for many machine learning problems (especially when combined with ensemble methods)\n",
    "* Decision trees are a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) - you traverse them in a specified direction, and there are no \"loops\" in the graphs to go backwards\n",
    "* Algorithms for generating decision trees are designed to maximize the information gain from each split\n",
    "* A popular algorithm for generating decision trees is ID3 - the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm\n",
    "* There are a range of pruning hyperparameters for decision trees to reduce overfitting - including maximum depth, minimum samples leaf with split, minimum leaf sample size, maximum lead nodes and maximum features\n",
    "* CART (Classification and Regression Trees) trees can be used for regression tasks"
