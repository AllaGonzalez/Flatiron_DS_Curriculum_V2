This test case diverts a little bit from the training set cases observed earlier. While the max margin classifier would classify this test set case correctly, the hyperplane closer to the right would have been classified incorrectly. Of course this is just one example, and other test cases will end up in a different spots. Nonetheless, the purpose of choosing the max margin classifier is to minimize the generalization error when applying the model to future unseen data points."
