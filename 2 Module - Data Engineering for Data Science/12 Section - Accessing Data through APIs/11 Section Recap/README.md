# Section Recap

## Introduction

In this section, you learned about the request/response cycle and using APIs. APIs are critical to software development, and they can be powerful tools for gathering data for data scientists.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

APIs can provide access to a wide range of data that you might need as a data scientist. Key takeaways:
* While there are many other kinds of APIs, as a data scientist, you'll typically be working with web APIs
* The Requests library in Python is a great starting point for making http(s) requests to APIs
* The two most common http methods you will use when accessing APIs are GET (to retrieve information) and POST (to send information).
* Typically you'll need to authenticate in some manner with most APIs - one common methods for doing so is using OAuth
