    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about the popular NoSQL Database **_MongoDB_**, including how to install it on our machine, connect to a mongo database, add how to use it to **_C_**reate / **_R_**ead / **_U_**pdate / **_D_**elete (**CRUD**) data!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "-  Use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database\n",
    "-  Create, Read, Update, and Delete Information in MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and Running MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is easy--in order to install mongoDB, we'll use our favorite package manager, conda! This part works the same, regardless of what operating system you're running. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install mongoDB on your machine, open a terminal or conda command prompt and just type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install mongodb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to create a directory to store our Mongo data files \n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mkdir -p /data/db`\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the directory the correct permission. \n",
    "\n",
    "``sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to run our server! In that same command prompt, just type `mongod`. You'll see the server start up instantly.  Note that you must leave this terminal process running in order to make use of the mongoDB instance, so you'll need to leave this one alone, and open a new terminal or command prompt window when you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examining a Sample MongoDB Record\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in the previous lesson on NoSQL databases, MongoDB is a **_Document Store_**. Each record is a JSON document, which can in turn contain other JSON documents in a nested format. \n",
    "\n",
    "For intance, here's an example record we might seen in a MongoDB database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",

    "This is more common than you might realize--if you open this file, `index.ipynb`, in a text editor, you'll see that each Jupyter Notebook is structure the exact same way, with each cell and everything it contains being embedded in the larger overall document!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have experience working with JSON, we'll see that it will actually be quite easy to work with data in mongoDB! Let's explore how to execute _CRUD_ operations in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the MongoDB Database\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the MongoDB server and connect to our database, we can just type `mongod` in the terminal or conda command prompt. This will create an instance of a MongoDB server containing our mongo database. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're now connected to the mongo server. Next, we need to access this server's shell. To do this, open a new terminal window and type `mongo`. Now, you are inside your mongo server and can work with mongo files (databases). To get started, we'll look at what databases this server has access to. Type the command `db`--you should see a database called `test`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mongodb server that's running comes with a host of built-in functions that we can use. To see a full list of the functions for the mongo server itself, we can type `db.help()`. Similarly, the databases themselves have a host of built-ins and functions accessible to us to do things like count the total number of documents in the database and other tasks that might be useful. See those, we can access the documentation for the `test` database by typing `db.test.help()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Try doing both of these now, and look around for a minute to familiarize yourself with some of the things that both the server and the database are capable of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll use some of the built-in functions in the `test` database to create and access different records. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting Information in MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the main way you'll be working with MongoDB is through a python library called `pymongo` that allows us to connect to and manipulate mongo databases in our code, just like `sqlite3` allowed us to connect to and work with SQLite databases in the last section. However, before we do that, it's worth taking a quick look at how we can add data directly to the database through the command line with the running mongo server instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type the following in the terminal running the mongo instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "`db.test.save( { a: 1 } )`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble getting this line of code to work, make sure the spacing is exactly as seen in the example above--each unique character inside the method call is separated by a space, with the exception of the colon, which comes right after the key we want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this line correctly, you'll see the database return a  key value pair showing `_id` as the key and a long, jumbled string of numbers and letter that act as the unique ID for the document we just inserted as the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see a full list of every document stored in the database, we can use `db.test.find()`--run this now to see the key-value record for the document we created and inserted above. Note that this isn't really practical for anything other than toy databases. For any real work we'll be doing with a mongo database, we'll doing it through python rather than directly on the mongo server itself. Let's take a look at how we can write queries or do CRUD operations in python with the `pymongo` library!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Mongodb through Python with `pymongo`\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting to mongodb through a python library is going to feel very similar to the boilerplate code we had to use to connect to a SQLite database. To connect to our mongo server through python, we have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `pymongo` library\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a client that is connected to our running mongodb server by using the `pymongo` library's `MongoClient` object and passing it the URL for the server (which the mongo server told us as output when we started it up at the very beginning).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get the database that we'll be working with from the `myclient` object--this can include creating a new database by passing in it's name as a key, just as if we were trying to get it from a python dictionary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do this now in the cells below as an example. "
