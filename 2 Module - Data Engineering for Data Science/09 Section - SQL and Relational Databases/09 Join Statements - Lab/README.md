# Join Statements - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice your knowledge of `JOIN` statements, using various types of joins and various methods for specifying the links between them.

## Objectives

You will be able to:
- Write queries that make use of various types of Joins
- Join tables using foreign keys

## CRM Schema

In almost all cases, rather then just working with a single table you will typically need data from multiple tables. 
Doing this requires the use of **joins** using shared columns from the two tables. 

In this lab, you'll use the same Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database that you saw from the previous lesson.
