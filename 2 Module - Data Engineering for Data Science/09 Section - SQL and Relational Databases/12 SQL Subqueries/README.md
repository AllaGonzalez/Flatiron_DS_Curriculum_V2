# SQL Subqueries

## Introduction

SQL queries can get complex. For example, you might have been a little thrown off by the many to many join in the last lab. There, you had to join four tables. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Depending on how your database is set up, you might have to join subset views of multiple tables. When queries get complex like this, it is often useful to use the concept of subqueries to help break the problem into smaller, more digestible tasks.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Write subqueries to decompose complex queries

## Our Customer Relation Managment Database Schema

As a handy reference, here's the schema for the CRM database you'll continue to practice with.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```


```python
conn = sqlite3.Connection('data.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()
```

## All of the Employees From the United States

Let's start with a query of employees from the United States. Using your current knowledge, you could solve this using a join.


```python
cur.execute("""SELECT lastName, firstName, officeCode
               FROM employees
               JOIN offices
               USING(officeCode)
               WHERE country = "USA";
               """)
df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())
df.columns = [x[0] for x in cur.description]
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>lastName</th>
      <th>firstName</th>
      <th>officeCode</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Bow</td>
      <td>Anthony</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Firrelli</td>
      <td>Jeff</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Jennings</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Murphy</td>
      <td>Diane</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Patterson</td>
      <td>Mary</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Thompson</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>Firrelli</td>
      <td>Julie</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>Patterson</td>
      <td>Steve</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>Tseng</td>
      <td>Foon Yue</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Vanauf</td>
      <td>George</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Another approach would be to use a subquery. Here's what it would look like:


```python
cur.execute("""SELECT lastName, firstName, officeCode
               FROM employees
               WHERE officeCode IN (SELECT officeCode
                                    FROM offices 
                                    WHERE country = "USA");
                                    """)
df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())
df.columns = [x[0] for x in cur.description]
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>lastName</th>
      <th>firstName</th>
      <th>officeCode</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Murphy</td>
      <td>Diane</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Patterson</td>
      <td>Mary</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Firrelli</td>
      <td>Jeff</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Bow</td>
      <td>Anthony</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Jennings</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Thompson</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>Firrelli</td>
      <td>Julie</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>Patterson</td>
      <td>Steve</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>Tseng</td>
      <td>Foon Yue</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Vanauf</td>
      <td>George</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

There it is, a query within a query! This can be very helpful and also allow you to break down problems into constituent parts. Often queries can be formulated in multiple ways as with the above example. Other times, using a subquery might be essential. For example, what if you wanted to find all of the employees from offices with at least 5 employees?  

Think for a minute about how you might write such a query.  


Now that you've had a minute to think it over, you might see some of the challenges with this query. On the one hand, we are looking to filter based on an aggregate condition: the number of employees per office. You know how to do this using the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses, but the data we wish to retrieve is not aggregate data. We only wish to filter based on the aggregate, not retrieve aggregate data. As such, this is a natural place to use a subquery.


```python
cur.execute("""SELECT lastName, firstName, officeCode
               FROM employees
               WHERE officeCode IN (SELECT officeCode 
                                    FROM offices 
                                    JOIN employees
                                    USING(officeCode)
                                    GROUP BY 1
                                    HAVING COUNT(employeeNumber) >= 5);
                                    """)
df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())
df.columns = [x[0] for x in cur.description]
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>lastName</th>
      <th>firstName</th>
      <th>officeCode</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Murphy</td>
      <td>Diane</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Patterson</td>
      <td>Mary</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Firrelli</td>
      <td>Jeff</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Bondur</td>
      <td>Gerard</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Bow</td>
      <td>Anthony</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Jennings</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>Thompson</td>
      <td>Leslie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>Bondur</td>
      <td>Loui</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>Hernandez</td>
      <td>Gerard</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Castillo</td>
      <td>Pamela</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10</th>
      <td>Gerard</td>
      <td>Martin</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



You can chain queries like this in many fashions. For example, maybe you're also a statistical geek and want to find the average of individual customers average payments:

(It might be more interesting to investigate the standard deviation of customer's average payments, but standard deviation is not natively supported in sqlite as it is in other sql versions like postgreSQL.)


```python
cur.execute("""SELECT AVG(cutomerAvgPayment) AS averagePayment
               FROM (SELECT AVG(amount) AS cutomerAvgPayment
                     FROM payments
                     JOIN customers USING(customerNumber)
                     GROUP BY customerNumber);""")
df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())
df.columns = [x[0] for x in cur.description]
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>averagePayment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>31489.754582</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## Summary

In this lesson, you were briefly introduced to the powerful concept of subqueries and how you can use them to write more complex queries. In the upcoming lab you'll really start to strengthen your SQL and data wrangling skills by using all of the SQL techniques introduced thus far.
