# Object Attributes - Lab

## Introduction
In this lab, you'll practice defining classes and instance methods. 

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Practice defining classes and instantiating instances of those classes
* Practice defining instance methods

## Defining Classes and Instance Methods

In the cell below define a `Driver` class.

For this class, create a method called `greet_passenger`, which returns the string `Hello! I'll be your driver today. My name is ` followed by that driver's first name and last name (i.e. `Hello! I'll be your driver today. My name is John Doe`). (Be sure to keep in mind that the driver's name will be stored under two seperate attributes: first and last.)


```python
# Define Driver Class here with properties for each instance variable
```

Great! Now create an instance of your driver class. Then, create the following attributes for your instance:
* first - the first name of the driver. Set it to Matthew.
* last - the last name of the driver. Set it to Mitchell.
* miles_driven - the number of miles driven by the driver. Set it to 100.
* rating - the drivers rating. Set it to 4.9

Finally, use your `greet_passenger1` method for your Driver instance object.


```python
#Create an instance with the above 4 attributes and then call the greet_passenger method
```

Now, create a passenger class with one method `yell_name` which prints the passengers first and last name in all caps. (Again first and last will be stored as seperate attributes.)


```python
# Define Passenger Class here with properties for each instance variable
```

Create an instance of your passenger class. Then create an attribute "first" set to "Ron" and an attribute "last" set to "Burgundy". Then call the `yell_name` method.


```python
#Create an instance of the passenger class with the first and last attributes. Then call the yell_name method
```

Great work!

## Summary
In this lab, you practiced defining classes, creating instances of said classes, and using methods that made calls to object attributes.
