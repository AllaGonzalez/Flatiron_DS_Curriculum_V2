    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn a little more about `self` in object-oriented Python (OOP). You've seen a little bit about self when you learned about defining and calling instance methods. So far you've seen that `self` is always explicitly defined as the instance method's **first parameter**. You've also seen that instance methods implicitly use the instance object as the **first argument** when you call the method. By convention, you name this first parameter `self` since it is a reference to the object on which you are operating. Let's take a look at some code that uses `self`."

For example, an instance object of a Person class can have descriptors like `height`, `weight`, `age`, etc. and also have behaviors such as `saying_hello`, `eat_breakfast`, `talk_about_weather`, etc. "
