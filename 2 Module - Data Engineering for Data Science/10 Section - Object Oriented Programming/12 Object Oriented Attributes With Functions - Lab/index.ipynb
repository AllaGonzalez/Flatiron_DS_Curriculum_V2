    "# Object Oriented Attributes With Functions - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "You've been learning a lot about different parts of object-oriented programming. You've learned about classes and what purpose they serve. You've seen instance objects, instance variables, and instance methods and how these things all work with each other. In this lab, you'll learn what a **domain model** is and how it ties into object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the concept of a domain model\n",
    "* Create a domain model\n",
    "* Define instance methods that operate on nested data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Domain Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A domain model is the representation of a real-world concept or structure translated into software. This is a key function of object orientation. So far, your Python classes have been used as blueprints or templates for instance objects of that class. As an example, a Driver class would create driver instance objects, and the class would define a basic structure for what that driver instance object should look like and what capabilities it should have. But a class is only one part of a domain model just as, typically, a driver is only one part of a larger structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A domain model is meant to mirror that larger, real-world structure. It is more than just one class, it is an entire environment that often depends on other parts or classes to function properly. So, in keeping with a Driver class, you could use the example of a taxi and limousine service as our domain model. There are many more parts to a service like this than drivers alone. You could imagine dispatchers, mechanics, accountants, passengers, etc., all being part of the structure of this domain model. In a simplified example, you could have instance and class methods handle things like `dispatch_driver`, `calculate_revenue_from_rides`, `service_taxi`, or any other function of a taxi and limousine service.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you become more fluent in object-oriented programming and our programs become more complex, you will see that the other parts of a domain model like passengers, dispatchers, etc., will be classes of their own which interact with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll be using a school as our domain model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Simple School Class\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, open up the **school.py** file in your text editor of choices such as Atom, Sublime, or a simple notepad program. Within this file, create a `School` class definition which will be initialized with the name of the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** the next cell imports an extension, `autoreload`, from IPython. The autoreload extension reloads any imported packages when methods from that package are called. While this is inefficient for stable packages such as NumPy which will be static while working in a notebook, the autoreload extension is quite useful when developing a package yourself. That is, you can update a package such as school.py and then test the effects in a notebook; with the autoreload extension, you'll see the effects of your changes to the package reflected. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> If you still have trouble with cells reflecting updates to the **school.py** file as you go along, go to the Kernel tab at the top of the jupyter notebook and click \"Restart & Run All\". This should smoothly run everything up to where you're working.\n",
