    "# OOP - Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as a foundational practice for software development and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Summarize the importance of OOP\n",
    "* Explain class attributes and methods\n",
    "* Explain `self` in classes\n",
    "* Explain the __init__ method\n",
    "* Explain object initialization\n",
    "* Explain object inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you learned all about Object Orientated Programming and how to define classes. Like functions, using classes in your programming can save you a lot of time and repetitive tasks. Classes go further then functions in allowing you to also persist data. After all, class methods are fairly analogous to functions, while attributes add additional functionality, acting as data storage containers. Moreover, classes have additional flexibility through inheritance, allowing you to define various levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw, the most basic class definition starts off with:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Class_name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, you then saw how you can further define methods to the class:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Class_name:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        pass #ideally a method does something, but you get the point\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",
    "        print('This is a pretty useless second method.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And from there, you learned more about `self` and the `__init__` method. Recall that the `__init__` method allows you to specify required and default parameters for you class instances. Furthermore, `self` then allows you to reference object attributes within class definitions. So for example, you might require a class to have a name and a number when instantiated:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Class_name:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, number):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.number = number\n",
    "    def update_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "        self.name = new_name\n",
    "    def update_number(self, new_number):\n",
    "        self.number = new_number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also add default behavior, allowing the user to not specify a specify parameter when they instantiate an instance of the class:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Class_name:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name=None, number=None):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.number = number\n",
    "    def update_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "        self.name = new_name\n",
    "    def update_number(self, new_number):\n",
    "        self.number = new_number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that once you define a class, you can then create instances of that class to bring it to life and use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might import the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn in order to create a regression model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, creating an instance of a class would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression() #importing our class definition\n",
    "reg = LinearRegression() #creating an instance of the class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create an instance object of the class, you can then use all the methods associated with that class!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you examined object inheritance. You saw that you can create sub classes. To create a subclass of a another class you simply reference the parent class when defining the child class as in:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Child_class(Parent_class):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there was a brief mention of python's `super()` function. While it can be useful, some caution should be warranted here; the `super()` function is substantially different between python 2 and 3, and is not as straightforward as it appears. If you're a Java programmer, `super()` will be familiar to you in many aspects, but still works differently in python. Your not apt to need its functionality early on in your programming, but if you wish to learn more, start by checking out its documentation further [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats! You now have a solid introduction to OOP which will be fundamental for collaboration and writing concise modular code!"
