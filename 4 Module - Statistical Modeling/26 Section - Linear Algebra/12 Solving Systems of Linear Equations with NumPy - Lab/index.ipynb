    "* Build a system of equations from given problem by creating matrix and vectors in NumPy\n",
    "* Calculate the inverse and dot-product to get the values for unknown variables.\n",
    "* Solve linear equations using `numpy.linalg.solve()`\n",

    "In this lab, you learned how to use Numpy to solve linear equations by taking inverses and matrix multiplication and also using numpy's `.solve()`. You'll now take these skills forward and see how you can define a simple regression problem using linear algebra and solve it with Numpy. "
