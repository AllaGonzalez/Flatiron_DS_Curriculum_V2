    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the lecture, time series visualizations play an important role in the analysis of time series data. Time series are often plotted to allow data diagnostics to identify temporal structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll cover main techniques for visualizing time series data in Python using the minimum daily temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia again. You might remember from the lesson that the units are in degrees Celsius and there are 3,650 observations. The [source](https://datamarket.com/data/set/2324/daily-minimum-temperatures-in-melbourne-australia-1981-1990) of the data is credited as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the temporal structure of time series with line plots\n",
    "* Understand and describe the distribution of observations using histograms and density plots\n",
    "* Measure the change in distribution over intervals using box and whisker plots and heat map plots\n",
