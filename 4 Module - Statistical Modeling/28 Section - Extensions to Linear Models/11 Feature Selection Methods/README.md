# Feature Selection

## Introduction

You've now learned about many different ways to create features to model more complex relationships. If you included interaction terms between all of your variables and high order polynomial functions, you will no doubt have an issue with overfitting to noise. In this lesson, you'll learn about the different techniques you can use to only use features that are most relevant to your model.

### Objectives

You will be able to:

* List the different methods of feature selection
* Identify when it is appropriate to use certain methods of feature selection
* Use feature selection on a dataset
* Demonstrate how different methods of feature selection are performed

### Purpose of Feature Selection

Feature selection is the process by which you select a subset of features relevant for model construction. Feature Selection comes with several benefits, the most obvious being the improvement of a machine learning algorithm. Other benefits include:

* Decrease in computational complexity: As the number of features are reduced in a model, the easier it will be to compute the parameters of your model. It will also mean a decrease in the amount of data storage required to maintain the features of your model.
* Understanding your data: In the process of feature selection, you will gain more of an understanding of how features relate to one another.

Now, let's look at the different types of feature selection and their advantages/disadvantages.

### Types of Feature Selection

Like many things in data science there is not a clear and easy answer for deciding what features to include in a model. There are however, different strategies you can use to process in the correct manner.


* Domain Knowledge
* Wrapper Methods
* Filter Methods
* Embedded Methods


#### Domain Knowledge   
One of the first steps a data scientist should take when trying to determine what types of features might be useful is knowledge of the specific domain related to your dataset. This might mean reading past research papers that have explored similar topics or asking to key stakeholders to determine what the believe the most important factors are for predicting something.


#### Wrapper Methods   
Wrapper methods determine the optimal subset of features using different combinations of features to train models and then calculating performance. Every subset is used to train models and then evaluated on a test set. As you might imagine, wrapper methods can end up being very computationally intensive, however they are highly effective in determining the optimal subset. Because wrapper methods are so time-consuming, it becomes challenging to use them with large feature sets.

An example of a wrapper method in linear regression is Recursive Feature Elimination, which starts with all features included in a model and removes them one by one. After the model has had a feature removed, whichever subset of features resulted in the least statistically significant deterioration of the model fit will indicate which omitted feature is the least useful for prediction. The opposite of this process is Forward Selection, which undergoes the same process in reverse. It begins with a single feature and continues to add the next feature that improves model performance the most. 

#### Filter Methods   
Filter methods are feature selection methods carried out as a pre-processing step before even running a model. Filter methods work by observing characteristics of how variables are related to one another. Depending on the model that is being used, different metrics are used to determine which features will get eliminated and which will remain. Typically, filter methods will return a "feature ranking" that will tell you how features are ordered in relation to one another. They will remove the variables that are considered redundant. It's up to the data scientist to determine the cut-off point at which they will keep the top n features, and this n is usually determined through cross validation.

In the linear regression context, a common filter method is to eliminate features that are too highly correlated with one another. Another method is to use a variance threshold. This sets some threshold of required variance for features in order to include them in a model. The thought process behind this is that if variables do not have a high variance, they will not change much and will therefore not have much impact on our dependent variable.


#### Embedded methods   
Embedded methods are feature selection methods that are included within the actual formulation of your machine learning algorithm. The most common kind of embedded method is regularization, in particular Lasso, because it has the capability of reducing your set of features automatically.

## Feature Selection in Action

Now, we're going to review the process behind performing feature selection with a dataset pertaining to diabetes. The dataset contains the independent variables age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and 6 different blood serum measurements. The target variable represents a quantitative measurement progression of diabetes from one year after a baseline observation. With feature selection, our goal is to find a model that is able to maintain high accuracy while not overfitting to noise.

### Processing the Data

To begin with, we are going to load the data and create a dummy variable for the variable SEX.


```python
# importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# reading in the data
df = pd.read_csv('diabetes.tab.txt', sep='\t', lineterminator='\n')

```


```python
# obtaining the X and Y variables from the dataframe
features = df.iloc[:,:-1]
target = df['Y']
# creating dummy variable for sex
features['female'] = pd.get_dummies(features['SEX'],drop_first=True)
features.drop(columns=['SEX'], inplace=True)
features.head()
```

For both regularization (an embedded method) and various filters, it is important to standardize the data. This next cell is fitting the data to a StandardScaler from sklearn.


```python
from sklearn import preprocessing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, random_state=20,test_size=0.2)
scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()

## scaling every feature except the binary column female
scaler.fit(X_train.iloc[:,:-1])
transformed_training_features = scaler.transform(X_train.iloc[:,:-1])
transformed_testing_features = scaler.transform(X_test.iloc[:,:-1])

X_train_transformed = pd.DataFrame(scaler.transform(X_train.iloc[:,:-1]), columns=X_train.columns[:-1], index=X_train.index)
X_train_transformed['female'] = X_train['female']

X_test_transformed = pd.DataFrame(scaler.transform(X_test.iloc[:,:-1]), columns=X_train.columns[:-1], index=X_test.index)
X_test_transformed['female'] = X_test['female']
```

Before we start subsetting features, we should see how well the model performs without performing any kind of interactions added or feature selection performed. Because we are going to be running many different models here, we have created a function to ensure that we are remaining D.R.Y. with our code.


```python
def run_model(model,X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test):
    
    print('Training R^2 :',model.score(X_train,y_train))
    y_pred_train = model.predict(X_train)
    print('Training Root Mean Square Error',np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_train,y_pred_train)))
    print('\n----------------\n')
    print('Testing R^2 :',model.score(X_test,y_test))
    y_pred_test = model.predict(X_test)
    print('Testing Root Mean Square Error',np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test,y_pred_test)))
```


```python
lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_train_transformed,y_train)
run_model(lm,X_train_transformed,X_test_transformed,y_train,y_test)
```

    Training R^2 : 0.5371947100976313
    Training Root Mean Square Error 52.21977472848369

The model has not performed exceptionally well here, so we can try adding some additional features. Let's go ahead and add a polynomial degree of up to 3.


```python
poly = preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=False, include_bias=False)
X_poly_train = pd.DataFrame(poly.fit_transform(X_train_transformed), columns=poly.get_feature_names(features.columns))
X_poly_test = pd.DataFrame(poly.transform(X_test_transformed), columns=poly.get_feature_names(features.columns))
X_poly_train.head()
```

As you can see, this has now created 65 total columns! You can imagine that this model will greatly overfit to the data. Let's try it out with our training and test set.


```python
lr_poly = LinearRegression()
lr_poly.fit(X_poly_train,y_train)

run_model(lr_poly,X_poly_train,X_poly_test,y_train,y_test)
```

    Testing R^2 : 0.36886944442517255
    Testing Root Mean Square Error 61.26777562691537


Clearly, the model has fit very well to the training data, but it has fit to a lot of noise. The testing $R^{2}$ is worse than our simple model we fit previously! It's time to get rid of some features to see if this improves the model.

## Filter Methods  
Let's begin by trying out some filter methods for feature selection. The benefit of filter methods is that they can provide us with some useful visualizations for helping us gain an understanding about characteristics of our data. To begin with, let's use a simple variance threshold to eliminate those features with a low variance.


```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

threshold_ranges = np.linspace(0,2,num=6)

for thresh in threshold_ranges:
    print(thresh)
    selector = VarianceThreshold(thresh)
    reduced_feature_train = selector.fit_transform(X_poly_train)
    reduced_feature_test = selector.transform(X_poly_test)
    lr = LinearRegression()
    lr.fit(reduced_feature_train,y_train)
    run_model(lr,reduced_feature_train,reduced_feature_test,y_train,y_test)
    print('--------------------------------------------------------------------')
```

Hmmm, that did not seem to eliminate the features very well. It's better than the base polynomial, but it is not any better than some of the more complicated.

## Wrapper Methods

Now let's use Recursive Feature elimination (RFE) to try out a wrapper method. You'll notice that sci-kit learn has a built in RFECV function, which automatically determines the optimal number of features to keep when it is run based off the estimator that is passed into it. Here it is in action: 


```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE, RFECV
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

rfe = RFECV(LinearRegression(),cv=5)
X_rfe_train = rfe.fit_transform(X_poly_train,y_train)
X_rfe_test = rfe.transform(X_poly_test)
lm = LinearRegression().fit(X_rfe_train,y_train)
run_model(lm,X_rfe_train,X_rfe_test,y_train,y_test)
print ("The optimal number of features is: ",rfe.n_features_)
```

    Testing Root Mean Square Error 61.00958305774434
    The optimal number of features is:  10


With Recursive Feature Elimination, we went from an $R^2$ score of 0.368 to 0.374 (a tiny bit better). Let's see if we can improve upon these results even more by trying embedded methods.

## Embedded Methods  
To compare to our other methods, we will use Lasso as the embedded method of feature selection. Luckily for us, sklearn has a builtin method to help us find the optimal features! It performs cross validation to determine the correct regularization parameter (how much to penalize our function).


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
lasso=LassoCV(max_iter=100000,cv=5)
lasso.fit(X_train_transformed,y_train)
run_model(lasso,X_train_transformed,X_test_transformed,y_train,y_test)
print("The optimal alpha for the Lasso Regression is: ",lasso.alpha_)
```

    Training Root Mean Square Error 52.33475174961373
    
    ----------------
    
    Testing R^2 : 0.4267044232634857
    Testing Root Mean Square Error 58.39313677555575
    The optimal alpha for the Lasso Regression is:  0.23254844944953376


Let's compare this to a model with all of the polynomial features included.


```python
lasso2 = LassoCV(max_iter=100000,cv=5)

lasso2.fit(X_poly_train,y_train)
run_model(lasso2,X_poly_train,X_poly_test,y_train,y_test)
print("The optimal alpha for the Lasso Regression is: ",lasso2.alpha_)
```

    Training R^2 : 0.5635320505309954
    Training Root Mean Square Error 50.71214913665365
    
    ----------------
    
    Testing R^2 : 0.43065954589620015
    Testing Root Mean Square Error 58.191363260874226
    The optimal alpha for the Lasso Regression is:  1.7591437388826368


As we can see, the regularization had minimal effect on the performance of the model, but it did improve the RMSE for the test set ever so slightly! There are no set steps someone should take in order to determine the optimal feature set. In fact, now there are automated machine learning pipelines that will determine the optimal subset of features for a given problem. One of the most important and often overlooked methods of feature selection is using domain knowledge about a given area to either eliminate features or create new ones.

## Summary

This lesson formalized the different types of feature selection and introduced some new techniques to you. You learned about Filter Methods, Wrapper Methods, and Embedded Methods as well as advantages and disadvantages to both. In the next lab, you'll get a chance to test out these feature selection methods and everything else you've learned in this section to make the optimal model!
