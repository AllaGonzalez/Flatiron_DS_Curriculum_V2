    "Previously, you've seen how you can select ways of assessing your model fit metrics like MSE, SSE, and $R^2$. These values almost always improve when adding more variables, so if you only use these metrics to determine the optimal features of your model, overfitting is likely. You're going to be introduced to two new measures here: the AIC and the BIC.\n",

    "The AIC is generally used to compare each candidate model. The nice thing about the AIC is that for every model that uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the log-likelihood is automatically computed, and as a consequence, the AIC is very easy to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AIC acts as a penalized log-likelihood criterion, giving a balance between a good fit\n",
    "(high value of log-likelihood) and complexity (complex models are penalized more than fairly simple ones). The AIC is unbounded so can take any type of value, but the bottom line is that when comparing models, the model with the **lowest** AIC should be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that directly comparing the values of log-likelihood maxima for different models (without including the penalty) is not good enough for model comparison because including more parameters in a model will *always* give rise to an increased value of the maximum likelihood. Due to that reason, searching for the model with maximal log-likelihood\n",
    "would always lead to the model with the most parameters. The AIC balances this by penalizing for number of parameters, hence searching for models with few parameters but fitting the data well.\n",
