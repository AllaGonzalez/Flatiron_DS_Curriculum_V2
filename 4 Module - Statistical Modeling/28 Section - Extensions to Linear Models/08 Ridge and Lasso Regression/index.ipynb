Regularization is based on the concept of penalizing larger coefficients, so if you have features that are on different scales, some will get unfairly penalized. Below, you can see that we are using a MinMaxScaler to standardize our data to the same scale. A downside of standardization is that the value of the coefficients become less interpretable and must be transformed back to their original scale if you want to interpret how a one unit change in a feature impacts the target variable."
