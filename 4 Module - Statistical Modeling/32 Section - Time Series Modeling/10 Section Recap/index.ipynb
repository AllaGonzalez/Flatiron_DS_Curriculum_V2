    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you learned about time series modeling! Let's review some of the specific things you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and explain what was covered in this section\n",
    "* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* A White Noise model has a fixed and constant mean and variance, and no correlation over time\n",
    "* A Random Walk model has no specified mean or variance, but has a strong dependence over time\n",
    "* The Pandas `corr()` function can be used to return the correlation between various time series data sets\n",
    "* Autocorrelation allows us to identify how strongly each time series observation is related to previous observations\n",
    "*  The autocorrelation function (ACF) is a function that represents autocorrelation of a time series as a function of the time lag\n",
    "* The Partial Autocorrelation Function (or PACF) gives the partial correlation of a time series with its own lagged values, controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags\n",
    "* ARMA (AutoRegressive and Moving Average) modeling is a tool for forecasting time series values by regressing the variable on its own lagged (past) values\n",
    "* ARMA models assume that you've already detrended your data and that there is no seasonality\n",
    "* ARIMA (Integrated ARMA) models allow for detrending as part of the modeling process and work well for data sets with trends but no seasonality\n",
    "* SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models allow for both detrending and seasonality as part of the modeling process\n",
    "* Fracebook Prophet enables data analysts and developers alike to perform forecasting at scale in Python\n",
    "* Prophet uses Additive Synthesis for time series forecasting\n",
