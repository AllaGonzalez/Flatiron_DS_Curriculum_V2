When classifying a binary variable, however, a model is either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to quantify this in terms of how many false positives versus false negatives we come across. In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this review lab, we'll review precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "You will be able to:  \n", "* Understand and assess precision, recall, and accuracy of classifiers\n", "* Evaluate classification models using various metrics\n", "\n", "## Terminology Review  \n", "\n", "Let's take a moment and review some classification evaluation metrics:  \n", "\n", "\n", "$Precision = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Predicted Positives}}$    \n", "  \n", "\n", "$Recall = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Actual Total Positives}}$  \n", "  \n", "$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives + True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Observations}}$\n", "\n", "$\\text{F1-Score} = 2\\ \\frac{Precision\\ x\\ Recall}{Precision + Recall}$\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["At times, it may be superior to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precision or recall rather than overall accuracy.

In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is preferable to optimize for recall, the number of cancer positive cases, then it is to optimize precision, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## 1.
