Since `Race` and `Sex` are categorical, we converted them to dummy variables using the `get_dummies()` method. The ```get_dummies()``` method will only convert `object` and `category` data types to dummy variables so it is safe to pass `Age`. Note that we also passed two additional arguments, ```drop_first=True``` and ```dtype=float```. The ```drop_first=True``` argument removes the first level for each categorical variable and the ```dtype=float``` argument converts the data type of all of the dummy variables to float. The data must be float in order to obtain accurate statistical results from statsmodel. Finally, note that y itself returns a pandas DataFrame with two columns as y itself was originally a categorical variable. With that, it's time to try and define a logistic regression model on your own!"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Your Turn - Step 1: Import the Data\n", "\n", "Import the data stored in the file **titanic.csv**."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Your code here"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Step 2: Define X and Y\n", "\n", "For your first foray into logistic regression, you are going to attempt to build a model that classifies whether an individual survived the Titanic shipwreck or not (yes it's a bit morbid).
