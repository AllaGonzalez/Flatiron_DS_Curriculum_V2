    "* Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function which helps to plot an \"s\" like curve that enables a linear function to act as a binary classifier\n",
    "* Like other classifiers, you can evaluate logistic regression models using some combination of precision, recall and accuracy\n",
    "* A confusion matrix is another common way to visualize the performance of a classification model\n",
    "* Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) can be used to help determine the best precision-recall tradeoff for a given classifier\n",
    "* Class weights, under/oversampling, and SMOTE can be used to deal with class imbalance problems"
