In the case of logistic regression, you are looking to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual data labels. To do this, you first calculate an error vector based on the current model's feature weights. You then multiply the transpose of the training matrix itself by this error vector in order to obtain the gradient. Finally, you take the gradient, multiply it by the step size and add this to our current weight vector to update it. Below, write such a function. It will take 5 inputs:  \n",

Use your logistic regression function to train a model. As the model trains, record the iteration cycle of the gradient descent algorithm and the weights of the various features. Then, plot this data on subplots for each of the individual features. Each graph should have the iteration number on the x-axis and the value of that feature weight for that iteration cycle on the y-axis. This will visually display how the algorithm is adjusting the weights over successive iterations, and hopefully show convergence to stable weights."
