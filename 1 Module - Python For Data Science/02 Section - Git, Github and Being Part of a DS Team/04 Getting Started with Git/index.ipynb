The Learn platform at Flatiron school has a deep integration with Git and GitHub. GitHub is an online hosting platform that uses git. We need to teach you just enough git to interact with GitHub like a real developer. While you can run python notebooks on the Learn platform itself, you'll also want to be able to download material to your local computer so you can work on it there.\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to:\n", "\n", "* Fork a repository from GitHub to create your own local copy.\n", "* Use `git clone` to clone a repository to your local computer.\n", "* Use `git status` to see the status of your locally cloned git repository.\n", "* Use `git add .` to add your local changes to be committed.\n", "* Use `git commit -am \"Commit Message\"` to commit changes that have been added with a message.\n", "* Use `git push` to upload your local changes to GitHub.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Some terminology and concepts\n", "\n", "As you can see from the objectives above, we're going to dive in and use several git commands in this lesson. \n", "\n", "The first that we'll use is `forking`, a concept from the github platform.\n", "\n", "Forking is the process of making a personal copy of the Learn lab on GitHub.
