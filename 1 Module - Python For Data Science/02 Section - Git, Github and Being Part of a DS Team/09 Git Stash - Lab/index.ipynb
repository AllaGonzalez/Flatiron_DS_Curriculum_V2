Sometimes, workflows aren't quite as linear or straightforward as those examples we've discussed thus far. For example, if both the local and remote versions of a repository have been updated at the same time, you may encounter merge conflicts! Essentially, git is unsure of which changes to incorporate if both versions of the repository have changed the same line of the same file. In these cases, git stash can be a valuable tool: it allows you to *stash* away your changes for later use!\n", "                                       \n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to:\n", "\n", "* Explain some use cases for `git stash`\n", "* Use a git stash to store changes\n", "* Apply stashed changes to multiple branches\n", "\n", "## Return to Your Git Repository/Folder from the Git Merge Lab\n", "\n", "Since we're doing another git investigation, let's start by working from our previously created git repository.\n", "\n", "## Check `git status`\n", "\n", "Hopefully, you should see the usual:  \n", "\n", "```On branch master\n", "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n", "```\n", "\n", "If not, add and commit your changes and recheck git status.\n", "\n", "## Make Some Changes\n", "\n", "Now that we have a clean working directory, let's muck things up!

Git stash is often useful when you need to quickly store away your changes and don't wish to create a new branch; you intend to quickly reintroduce these changes but need to put them to the side for a moment. This can be helpful if the remote repository has been updated and you first need to fetch and pull it, but have already also made some changes locally. In this and other cases, it's often easiest to first just stash the changes and then apply them subsequently. Similarly, we also saw that stashed changes can be applied to multiple branches. Overall, the more you use git and its myriad of tools, the more options you'll have for organizing and synchronizing your development process.\n", "\n"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
