In this lab, you'll work primarily from the command line in order to create a git repository, create a development branch and practice merging updates into a master copy. Along the way, you'll see how python scripts can be run from the command line and continue to get more familiar with git and bash in general!\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to:\n", "    \n", "* Initialize a git repository\n", "* Add a branch to a git repository\n", "* Merge updates from one branch into another\n", "\n", "## Create a Local Folder to House the Git Repository\n", "\n", "To start, create a folder from the command line.

What's more, we also saw that you can use git locally with no remote connection to github if you wish!"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.4"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
