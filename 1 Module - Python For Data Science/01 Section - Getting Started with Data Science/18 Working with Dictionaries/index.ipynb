Well, there are! In this lesson, we will introduce **dictionaries**. As we know, lists represent a collection of information that is ordered, like a list of the most watched TV shows.  However, in different situations, we may want our data to represent attributes of an entity, such as the various attributes of a single TV show like its name, genre, starring actors, etc.  For scenarios where the stored objects have no definitive order, but need to be retrieved, a **dictionary** is more natural. Dictionaries are _unordered_ collections of key-value pairs. Rather then specifying a positional index as with lists, we specify a key for a dictionary and are returned with the value associated with that key. For example, in a list, we could retrieve the third item with ExList[2] (remember indexing starts at 0), while in a dictionary, there is no specific third item. Instead, we would have to specify a key such as AcronymnDict['GDPR'] to retrieve the associated value attached to that key. This is similar to traditional dictionaries: you look up a specific word (the key) to find its associated definition (the value).\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "You will be able to:\n", "* Understand dictionaries and how to use them\n", "\n", "## Why Use a Dictionary When We Have Lists?\n", "\n", "While lists are great, for *listing* information like we mentioned earlier, they can actually become very messy when we are trying to use them to organize data which is more a bit more complex. Let's look at a brief example of a person.\n", "\n", "Every person has a **name**, **age**, **height** (in inches), **weight** (in lbs), and **fav_lang**.

We just have to ***remember*** that Terrance's favorite programming language comes fifth in his list of information? What if he has more attributes than just the five that are listed (i.e. native_language, hometown, etc.)? What if his attributes are in a different order than we expected? We can see that this list would easily breakdown and cause more problems than it solves.\n", "\n", "However, if we use a dictionary, we can more neatly organize this information and make it easier for us to use as the dictionary grows. Let's see what Terrance's information would look like using a dictionary.\n", "\n", "```python\n", "terrance = {'name': \"Terrance\", 'age': 25, 'weight': 72, 'height': 165, 'fav_lang': \"Python\"}\n", "```\n", "\n", "This dictionary definitely has more text in it, but we can see a direct association between the *attribute* or **key** and its correlated **value** (i.e. `{\"key\": \"value\"}`).
