    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we will be looking at how to perform nested iteration (or looping). What does this mean exactly? Well, we know that a nested data structure is having one form of data nested inside another. For example, a nested list would be a list that contains another list, or a dictionary that has a key that points to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# nested lists\n",
    "list_of_lists = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [3,5,2]]\n",
    "dict_nested_list = { 'name': \"example\", 'colors': [\"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"red\"] }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with that example, we can infer that a nested loop would be a loop inside another loop. Sounds exciting, right? Let's take a look at some nested loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Combine different types of loops\n",
    "* Understand, explain and use nested loops to iterate through nested data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing A Nested Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with a nested data structure is a little confusing at first, but after doing it a few times it becomes much less intimidating. The same is true for writing nested loops. They are something that will be somewhat commonplace in our programming future and are important to be comfortable with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what happens with a nested loop is the inner loop runs in its entirety **every** iteration of the outer loop. Let's take a look at an example before diving too much deeper."

    "## How Nested Loops Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so, what we see happening here is that the **inner** loop runs through each of its iterations for each iteration of the **outer** loop. If we break this down even further, we can think of the block inside of a loop as a single operation. The current iteration only moves on to the next iteration once it has completed the entire operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the operation of the outer loop is to print a string and execute a for loop on the `inner_words` collection. The outer block will do this three times. **BUT** the nested loop has to finish before the next iteration of the outer loop. The nested loop's job is to print its string three times, so that happens for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",

    "In this lesson, we introduced nested loops. Nested loops are exactly what they sound like. A loop inside of another. Nested iteration is helpful when dealing with nested collections in cases where we would like to dynamically access and use nested data contained in these collections. Nested loops can quickly become hard to read and maintain, so, it is important to use them wisely and sparingly."
