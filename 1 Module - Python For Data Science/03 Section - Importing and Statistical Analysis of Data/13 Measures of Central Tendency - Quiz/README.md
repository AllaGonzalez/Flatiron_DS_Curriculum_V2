# Measures of Central Tendency

## Objectives

* Understand and describe the significance of measuring central tendency of continuous data
* Understand the formula and intuition behind the mean, median, mode and modal class
* Compare mean-median-mode, along with histograms to explain the central tendency of given data

While we recommend using python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.
