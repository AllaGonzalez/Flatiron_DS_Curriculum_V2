    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickle is an invaluable tool for saving objects. Think about the importance of being able to save data files to csv, or another format. For example, you start with a raw dataset which you may have downloaded from the web. Then you painstakingly take hours preprocessing the data, cleaning it, constructing features, aggregates and other views. In order to avoid having to rerun your entire process, you are apt to save the current final cleaned version of the dataset. Similarly, pickle allows you to save any object that is currently loaded into your python interpreter. Literally anything. You could save data stored in a dictionary, list or set as a pickle file. You can also save functions, or class instances as pickle files. Saving models is one of the important use cases of this. \n",

    "The bottom code snippet is what is pertinent to the current pickle discussion. Here, just like our previous pickle examples, you can see how to save the model instance `reg` is saved to file. In other words, we have saved a trained model to disk. If you are using large production datasets where training can take a substantial amount of time and resources, then saving these model weights is essential. Similarly, you can see how easy it is to reload the saved model from file using `pickle.loads()`."
